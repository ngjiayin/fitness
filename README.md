# Project 1: Website Scraping - Gym Capacity (Python)
- Used BeautifulSoup to extract NUS's University Town Gym pax.
- Every 3 minutes, the code gathers the date, time and pax.
- To-do next: use the data to plot a bar chart to determine the optimal time to visit the gym (the least crowd).

# Project 2: Data Manipulation - Analysing Step Count Trend (R)
- Used dplyr package to analyse and answer questions relating to my step count, recorded via my iPhone's Apple Health
- Figured out which day of the week I walked the most in 2023 by taking the sum
- To-do next: Conclude using average daily steps instead, as some days have more data than others (because of calendar cut-off)
